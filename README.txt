# risqueAccidentRegen_phase3
This project aims at assessing the relative risk of loss of forest productivity due to regeneration failure following successive disturbances under a variety of management scenarios.

This repository contains all the code required to reproduce the simulation experiment. Documentation will be completed shortly. In the mean time, contact Dominic Cyr (cyr.dominic [at] gmail.com) for additional information.
